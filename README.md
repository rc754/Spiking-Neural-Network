# Image Reconstruction using Spiking Neural Network


This is the python implementation of hardware efficient spiking neural network. It includes the modified learning and prediction rules which could be realised on hardware and are enegry efficient. Aim is to develop a network which could be used for on-chip learning as well as prediction.

Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) algorithm will be used to train the network.

The SNN model used in this work is the feed-forward network, each neuron is connected to
all the neurons in the next layer by a weighted connection, which means that the output signal
of a neuron has a different weighted potential contribution . Input neurons require spike trains
and input signals (stimuli) need to be encoded into spikes (typically, spike trains) to further
feed the SNN.

## Network Elements
- Image Encoding: The encoding an image involves the conversion of the pixel values to spike train.
- Synapse: In an SNN, synapse is the weighted path for generated spikes from one neuron to the other connected neurons.
- Neuron: Neuron is the fundamental unit of an SNN. The input, hidden and output layers consist of several iterconnected neurons and this neuron emulates the classic leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)model.

## Dataset 
The MNIST database of handwritten digits contains 60,000 and 10,000 training and test samples respectively. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.The data set is useful for learning techniques and pattern recognition testing on real-world data an it doesnâ€™t a lot of pre-processing and formatting. Each image is of the size 28 x 28 Pixel.

## Results
Reconstruction was carried out using
the SNN architecture and employing brain learning algorithm, STDP. For an input image, we
have received three neuron outputs as the hidden layer had three neurons. According to the
results shown below, our winner neuron was the second neuron for 4.5 , and the rest two
neurons gave noise as the output, because their weights were depressed by lateral inhibition
technique which optimises our network. In figure 4.6 the winner neuron is the first neuron and
a reconstructed image similar to the input image is obtained.
